The initial start of a functioning Photo Gallery. 

Some HTML, CSS, and Javascript have already been created. 
Using jQuery, position the necessary elements to make the application look like the finished_gallery.png.

Download images.json file to get the source and textual description of photos to load into your gallery. The file is located at the following:
http://lyle.smu.edu/~craley/3345/http/images.json. I've also included a local copy of images.json within this project just in case you're running on a different
server.
